To reduce memory usage, we have removed the unused code located at:

Robust-Gymnasium/robust_gymnasium/envs/robosuite/models/assets/bullet_data

This code was not utilized in our experiments. However, these robots are still functional. If you wish to use them, simply download the corresponding files (from: https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite/tree/master/robosuite/models/assets/bullet_data) to the same directory.
